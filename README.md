# 🚀 My React Playground Projects  

Welcome to **My React Playground Projects**! This repository is a collection of **React.js mini-projects**, created to explore and experiment with different React concepts, features, and best practices.  

Each project serves as a **learning exercise**—from basic state management to advanced hooks, component architecture, and styling approaches.  

---

## 📌 What’s Inside?  

✅ **Mini Projects** – Independent React applications showcasing different features.  
✅ **Component-Based Design** – Modular and reusable UI components.  
✅ **State Management** – Using `useState`, `useReducer`, and possibly external libraries.  
✅ **React Hooks & Effects** – Implementations of `useEffect`, `useRef`, and custom hooks.  
✅ **Styling Techniques** – CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and Styled Components.  
✅ **Performance Optimizations** – Exploring memoization, lazy loading, and React Profiler.  

---

## 🎯 Why This Repository?  

Instead of keeping everything in a single project, this repository organizes **React sample projects separately** for better navigation and learning.  

Each project is self-contained, making it easy to **explore, clone, and run independently** without extra dependencies.  

If you’re learning React or looking for small reference implementations, feel free to **check out, modify, and experiment** with the code! 🚀

## 🔥 Future Plans  

🔹 Add React Router for navigation-based projects.  
🔹 Explore Redux, Zustand, and other state management libraries.  
🔹 API integrations with fetch/axios.  
🔹 Unit testing with Jest & React Testing Library.  
🔹 More complex UI components and performance optimizations.
